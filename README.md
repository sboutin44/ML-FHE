# **Linear Regression on Encrypted Data**

Homomorphic Encryption is a method allowing computation over encrypted data. This field is still in its early stages, primarily due to significant challenges such as extended processing times and high memory and storage demands inherent in its design. Nonetheless, it offers numerous applications, as it enables full end-to-end encryption, ensuring that only the data owner has access to the unencrypted information.

This is a work-in-progress. I am experimenting with popular open-source Fully Homomorphic Encryption libraries.
